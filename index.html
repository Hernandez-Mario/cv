    <p>Hello there, my name is Mario Herenandez. As of the creation of this html document (02/11/2021) I am 27 years old. Coming out of high school I had a strong desire to learn computer science.
    The innovation capable with programming is what initally caught my attention. I enrolled in an assoicates undergrad computer science program at my local community college. Going through my
    courses I discovered a passion that fueled a desire vs satisfying a need. During this time I was employed at a local industrial lumber and wooden pallet supplier. Working full-time
    in addition to attending school proved difficult. However, I was managing it and continue to succeed in my classes. I was dating my now wife and our love would birth my first child, Amelia.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This presented my first impactful fork in the road that would ultimately shape the next 8 years of my life. I proved to be a valuable employee and had been presented with my first big promotion.
       Many questions raced in my head upon hearing the opportunity presnted to me. Accepting the promotion was a no-brainer. I needed the pay increase to support my new family.
        However, I was unsure how I should proceed with my education from here. Do I continue my education in my current program? Should I switch to a program more applicable to my current position
        and continue my growth with this company? I chose the latter. I changed my major to business management, graduated the two-year program and transferred to a state university and
        completed another 3 semesters. I continued to grow with my employer and was being groomed to manage a large portion of the operation. I ultimately dropped out of university.
        The amount of stress and pressure to support my family, help run a business, and perform in my studies felt over bearing. My head space and discpline were not at a level to juggle all 3.
         Dropping one of the three allowed me to flourish in the other two. 5 years have passed since then and although happy,something felt missing </p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, in a better head space, support from friends and family, a strong work-ethic and discipline, I returned back to my original passion. I am currently learning to become a web developer and loving every minute of it. My goal is to simply learn a passion that I had ignored. Where I go from here is up to me. </p>
